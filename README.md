# deploy-OCI_TechnitiumDNS_rp-NPM
Explore practical deployments of simple [Technitium DNS](https://github.com/TechnitiumSoftware/DnsServer) instance(s) onto the free service tier of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure via Portainer stacks using Docker composed container configs serviced by a reverse proxy on a front-end Docker network.

### Objective: 

We want to determine of the default FOSS implementation of Technitium DNS supports RBAC, i.e.
1. multiple user accounts
   2. each controlling one or more independent DNS usage profiles


### Background:

This service deployment relies on the previous project: [deploy-OCI_Portainer-NPM-frontend](https://github.com/vyzed-public/deploy-OCI_Portainer-NPM-frontend/tree/main)
* Explore practical deployment of a Portainer web GUI instance onto the free service tier of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure that implements a reverse proxy for front-end network services using Nginx Proxy Manager.

### Approach:
* As we proceed, we'll [track our progress on a per-issue basis](https://github.com/vyzed-public/deploy-OCI_TechnitiumDNS_rp-NPM/issues), in a "GSD using micro-tasks" manner.
* We often stash ephemeral WIP in our personal DynaList -- in this case: **[project: Technitium DNS Server](https://dynalist.io/d/XoMkxmR1c7xCcPHNG4zUrWEi#z=xAGIe5yT4vtDiRqO1F495WGm)**.  
* Useful SOPs can be constructed from the [project history](https://github.com/vyzed-public/deploy-OCI_TechnitiumDNS_rp-NPM/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20sort%3Acreated-asc) (tracked via the ordered closed issues).
* A collection of useful [Resources, Tutorials, & Benchmark Projects](https://github.com/vyzed-public/deploy-OCI_TechnitiumDNS_rp-NPM/wiki/Useful-Resources,-Tutorials,-&-Benchmark-Projects) are in the [project wiki](https://github.com/vyzed-public/deploy-OCI_TechnitiumDNS_rp-NPM/wiki).

### Results:

Deployments to the following active instances:  
* Public DNS service: n/a 
* AdGuard Home web GUI: n/a
